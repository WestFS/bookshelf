### [[Beginner Developer]]
A beginner developer must master the very basics:
- Basic OOP:
    - Getters, setters, and constructors (Guanabara: [https://youtu.be/6i-_R5cAcEc](https://youtu.be/6i-_R5cAcEc))
    - At least understand how to create a `Fish extends Animal`, the basics of inheritance.
    - Final classes, methods, and fields (Carlos Henrique Java: [https://youtu.be/Uhph07-JfZs](https://youtu.be/Uhph07-JfZs))
    - Access modifiers: `protected`, `public`, and `private`
- Static methods, classes, and fields
- If, else, and else if
- Foreach (for)
- While
- Numeric types like Double, Float, Integer
- Arrays
- Throwing exceptions
- Try, catch, and finally

Also, understand:

- Method parameters
- Primitive types basics (`int`, `float`, `double`)
- Return statements: `return null;`, `return value;`, `return;`

**NEVER** create fields without an explicit access modifier, such as:

``` java
String text = "";
```

Always prefer using an access modifier:

``` java
private String text = "";
```

_Donâ€™t forget to use `final` whenever possible._

_This is where many give up._

**Note:** The more advanced you become, the less `static` you use in your code. Top Java developers aim to use ZERO `static`â€”you donâ€™t need it.

If youâ€™ve reached this level, youâ€™re more advanced. But you must learn these to earn a seat at the adult table:

- Knowledge of Git/GitHub
- Familiarity with a build tool:
    - Maven or Gradle (I recommend Maven, but itâ€™s personal preference)
- Advanced OOP:
    - Interfaces and their utilities (far more useful than they seem)
    - `record` classes and their lack of utility
    - Final method parameters
    - Sealed classes
    - Abstract methods in abstract classes
    - Utility classes (helper classes)
    - `import static`
- Annotations:
    - @Deprecated
    - Mastering @Override
    - At this level, stop suppressing warnings with @SuppressWarnings or similar hacks
- Clean code:
    - Basic JetBrains annotations ([https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations](https://github.com/JetBrains/java-annotations)):
        - @NotNull
        - @Nullable
        - @Range
        - @Internal and @Experimental
    - Early return technique (examples below)
- Creating custom `Exception` classes:
    - Understand the concepts of `Error`, `Throwable`, `RuntimeException`
    - Study existing exceptions, like `NullPointerException` and `IllegalStateException`
- Java Reflection:
    - Learn how to access private methods or fields and related concepts
- Intermediate knowledge of MySQL and SQLite (SQL in general)
- Libraries (native or third-party):
    - Master native Java classes to avoid reinventing the wheel
    - EVERYTHING about Generic Types (more complex than it seems)
        - Generic methods like `public final <T> T getValue()`
        - Unknown generic type `?`
    - Date classes: Date, OffsetDateTime, Duration, Instant, ZonedDateTime, LocalDateTime, etc.
    - JSON (Google's GSON recommended)
    - File handling
    - Learn `java.util.Optional`
    - Use `java.util.function.Consumer`, `Predicate`, and `Supplier`
    - Understand the difference between `Set<T>` and `List<T>`
    - Use `Map<K, V>`
    - Code optimization:
        - Streams:
            - `Stream#filter`
            - `Stream#map`
            - `Stream#anyMatch`
    - Serializable:
        - Many native exceptions implement this interfaceâ€”understand why
    - InputStream and OutputStream (study thoroughly)
    - Basics of Socket and Channel ([Netty.io](http://netty.io)):
        - Establishing connections and sending/receiving packets
    - UUIDs
- Overriding `equals()` and `hashCode()`:
    - Crucial for object behaviorâ€”donâ€™t ignore these methods
- Basics of cryptography (`MD5`, `SHA-256`, etc.)
- Intermediate/advanced mathematics:
    - Sine, cosine, tangent
    - Creating formulas for your projects
- Basic knowledge of regex
- Practice, lots of practice.
